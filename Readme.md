# Code Repository

Welcome to my **Code** repository! This is a public repository where I store my work, including:

- **Course Codes**: Scripts and exercises from various online courses.
- **Small Projects**: Personal projects that help me practice and apply new concepts.
- **Challenges**: Solutions to coding challenges from different platforms.
- **Miscellaneous**: Various other snippets and experiments that reflect my learning journey.

This repository primarily focuses on the languages I work with regularly, including **Python**, **SQL**, and **C++**.

## Purpose

The **Code** repository serves as both:

1. **A Personal Archive**: It documents my continuous evolution as a developer. From small scripts to more complex projects, this repository showcases my growth, mistakes, and improvements over time.
  
2. **A Contribution to the Community**: While many of the projects might seem simple, they represent my active participation in learning and problem-solving. By sharing this with the open-source community, I hope to inspire others to keep learning and growing, just as I am.

## Why Public?

Keeping this repository public is an intentional decision to stay accountable in my learning process, share knowledge, and track my personal and professional development. It is not only a place for others to see my progress but also for me to reflect on how far Iâ€™ve come.

Feel free to browse, learn, and contribute. Your feedback is always welcome!

## Technologies & Tools

This repository contains code written using the following technologies and tools:

- **Python**: For data analysis, automation, and scripting.
- **SQL**: For working with databases and querying data.
- **C++**: For performance-critical applications and learning low-level programming concepts.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive code and data analysis.
- **VS Code**: My preferred code editor.
